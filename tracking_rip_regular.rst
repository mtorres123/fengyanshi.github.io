Figure: (left) snapshot of surface elevation, (middle) vorticity field and (right) current field. The white dashed line represents trajectory. 

Refer to :ref:`section-rip-sediment-basics` and :ref:`section-rip-sediment-reg` from the :ref:`section-rip-sediment` example for simulation setup information. Here, the Lagrangian tracking is completed with the addition of the "tracers.txt" file (:ref:`section-tracking-basics`).
